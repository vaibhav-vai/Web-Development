          <h1>Vaibhav</h1>
          <h2>Student + Front-End Web Developer</h2>

          <p>Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>
          <p>I am currently pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Mechatronics & Automation from MIT ADT Uviverity.</p>
          <p>I am from the birthplace of 2 religions (Patna), highly ethical, and a task-driven professional with high grasping power.
            Familiar with technologies and their use with knowledge about their history. Can work under pressure and experienced in handling stress. 
            Versatile and flexible team player and can be a great leader. Very adaptable personality keen to secure a challenging
            position where I can effectively contribute my skills.</p>
          <p>I am a mechanical engineering student with a passion for front-end web development. 
            While my studies have focused on designing and building machines, I discovered my interest in web development through a personal 
            project and have been hooked ever since. With a keen eye for design and a love for problem-solving, I am constantly seeking new 
            challenges to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in web development. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and techniques 
            to create engaging and user-friendly websites that make a lasting impression. As you explore my portfolio, you'll find examples of my 
            work that showcase my abilities in front-end development. From responsive layouts to interactive animations, I strive to create 
            intuitive and visually appealing websites that exceed expectations. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to the 
            opportunity to work with you in bringing your web development project to life</p>

            <h3>AUTOMATIC HYDROPONIC PLANT GROW POT</h3>            
            <p>The goal of this project is to design and fabricate an Automatic Hydroponic Plant Grow Pot that provides an optimal environment for 
              plant growth without soil. The hydroponic system will use water and nutrient solutions to supply plants with the necessary nutrients 
              and will be fully automated to ensure minimal human intervention. The project will involve a combination of mechanical, electrical, 
              and software design to create a functional and user-friendly hydroponic system. The final product will be a cost-effective and 
              sustainable alternative to traditional soil-based farming, offering a new approach to indoor plant cultivation.</p>

            <h3>HUMAN FOLLOWING ROBOT</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on the design and development of a Human Following Robot. 
              The aim of the project is to create a robot that can follow a human and maintain a safe distance from them. The robot will be 
              equipped with infrared and ultrasonic sensors that will enable it to detect the human's movements and track their position, in real-time.The project will involve the integration of various hardware 
              components and software algorithms to create a functional and reliable human-following robot. Ultimately, the project aims 
              to demonstrate the potential of combining sensing technologies to create intelligent and responsive 
              robotic systems.</p>
